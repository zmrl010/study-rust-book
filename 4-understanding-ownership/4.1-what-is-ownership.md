# Ownership

## The Stack and the Heap

### Stack

* LastInFirstOut
* push onto the stack, pop off the stack
* All data stored must have a known, fixed size
* Data with unknown size at compile time must be stored on heap

### Heap

* less organized
* when you put data on Heap
* request certain amount of space
* memory allocator finds empty spot that is big enough
  * marks it as being in use
  * returns a _pointer_, which is the address of that location
* called _allocating_ on the heap

* pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data
  * the location is always at the top of the stack
* accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there.

* when calling function
  * pushes values onto stack
    * values passed into function and local variables
    * potentially including pointers to data on the heap
  * when function is over, values get popped off the stack

__Once you understand ownership, you won't need to think about the stack and the heap very often, but knowing that the main purpose of ownership is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it does.__

## Ownership Rules

* Each value in Rust has an owner.
* There can only be one owner at a time.
* When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
